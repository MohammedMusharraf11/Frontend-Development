   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch**: It’s recommended to work in a new branch for each contribution.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
4. **Make your changes**: Add new algorithms or enhance the existing ones. Be sure to write clean and well-documented code.
5. **Commit your changes**: Write meaningful commit messages that describe your changes clearly.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added [algorithm name] or Improved [functionality]"
   ```
6. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to your forked GitHub repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**: Navigate to this repository on GitHub, click “New Pull Request,” and follow the prompts.

## What We Expect:
- **Clarity**: Make sure your code is well-documented with comments and follows consistent formatting.
- **Efficiency**: Algorithms should be optimized for performance, with explanations if needed.
- **Readability**: Ensure your code is easy to understand for other contributors or learners.
- **Tested Code**: Please test your contributions before submitting a Pull Request (PR).

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure that your code or improvements are not already present in the repository. Check existing contributions before adding your own.
- Each algorithm should have a brief description of its purpose, time complexity, and use cases in the code comments or as a markdown file (if necessary).
- No plagiarized content. Always provide credit if you use or adapt existing solutions.
- Contributions should focus on common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming) or well-known problems (e.g., Fibonacci series, factorial) that can help others prepare for interviews or coding challenges.
